# hello-world
First repository learning project for getting started with Git Hub
I am a beginner level programmer with a few years practical application experience scripting in matlab for biomedical applications. Currently, I'm a weekend warrior playing with various OOP languages and apps e.g. C# for unity projects, C++ for various EEG related acquisition platforms, and Python for data science problems. I dib to dabble.
